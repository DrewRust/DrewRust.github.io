                                <h2>Exoplanets are planets outside our solar system.  Is the exoplanet Confirmed?  </h2>
                                <h3>Above is an artist's rendering of NASA's Kepler Space Telescope in search of them.<a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/beyond/overview/">NASA documents 4,164 and counting "Confirmed" exoplanets</a> discovered so far and thousands of other "Candidate" planets.  Below is the process I used to create data models using telescope observations to predict a planet's status.</h3>
                                <hr/>
                                
                                
                                <p>
                                As of writing this there are 4,164 "confirmed" exoplanets and the other "candidate" planets require more study to be confirmed.  The discovery method most often successful is the transit method as the exoplanet passes in between it's star and the telescope.  The dimming of the light from that star can then be measured and the orbit studied.</p>
                                
                                <p>
                                I chose the <a href="https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PS"> Planetary Systems Alpha release dataset (link) </a> which is essentially all the planetary data combined.  The data is 26,336 rows and 118 columns.  I looked at the columns and some had too many missing values, others were not helpful to predict if it was a confirmed planet, or the column variable was hard to understand.</p>

                                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                <p>This was a big dataset so it was really helpful to reduce the number of columns to better understand them.  Beginning with the Logistic Regression Model more columns were used to initially train the model.  Starting with 12 numeric and 3 categorical columns.  The 3 categorical columns would later become 18 features after being seperately encoded.  For instance, the column "st_metratio" became 5 seperate features.  The column "discoverymethod" became 9 and "disc_locale" would become 4 to create 18. Those added to the 12 numeric features created a total of 30 features. The model was then trained and again with only 11 of the most important features.</p>
                                
                                <p>Using all the same features for the Decision Tree Model it was able to fit itself to almost 100%.  So using 3 numeric columns and 1 categorical column it gave the Decision Tree and other Models more of a challenge.  After running a Random Forest and changing the parameters the score improved.  The best predictive model score with those 4 columns came from a Cross Validation Model with 5 folds of 20 iterations.  It took 5 minutes to train and make it's predictions on the test set.</p>
                                
                                <p>For this project I learned a lot about exoplanets and data modeling in the process.  I hope to continue learning and thank you for following along.</p>
